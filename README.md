# Artificial Intelligence Projects

This repository contains two separate academic projects completed as part of the Artificial Intelligence course. Each project explores different aspects of AI through practical implementations developed entirely from scratch, **without the use of pre-built machine learning libraries**.

## üß† Project 1 ‚Äì Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

This project focuses on implementing and analyzing **Artificial Neural Networks** designed from the ground up for two types of problems:

- **Regression problem** ‚Äì The network returns a numeric value.
- **Classification problem** ‚Äì The network predicts a class label.

The main objectives of the project include:

- Describing the selected problems and datasets.
- Conducting a literature review (including existing solutions to similar problems).
- Implementing custom neural networks without using ML libraries.
- Testing various architectural and training parameters, including:
  - Number of layers
  - Number of neurons per layer
  - Type of activation functions
  - Learning methods
  - Type of neural network
  - Size and selection method for train/test sets
- Evaluating each configuration on training and test sets.
- Repeating experiments multiple times to account for randomness in training.
- Reporting average and best results for each configuration.
- Drawing conclusions based on the findings.

üìÑ Detailed documentation and code can be found in the [`Neural_Networks/README.md`](./Neural_Networks/README.md).

## ü§ñ Project 2 ‚Äì Machine Learning Methods

This project investigates the performance of selected **classical machine learning algorithms** on the same problems used in the ANN project.

The methods covered include (at minimum):

- **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **SGD**

The main objectives are:

- Providing a brief theoretical summary of each method.
- Testing the effect of different hyperparameters (4 values per parameter), such as:
  - Distance metrics
  - Error metrics
  - Number of trees
  - Tree depth
  - Number of neighbors
  - Kernel type and polynomial degree
- Performing separate experiments for regression and classification tasks.
- Reporting and analyzing results.
- Drawing conclusions and comparing methods.

üìÑ Detailed documentation and code can be found in the [`Machine_Learning/README.md`](./Machine_Learning/README.md).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- All models were implemented from scratch, without using machine learning libraries such as Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.
- The aim was to gain hands-on experience with the internal workings of neural networks and machine learning algorithms.
- Each method was tested across multiple configurations and evaluated using appropriate metrics.
